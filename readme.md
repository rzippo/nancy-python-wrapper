# Nancy wrapper for Python

This project provides a Python library that provides (some of) the functionalities of the [Nancy library](https://github.com/rzippo/nancy) for Deterministic Network Calculus.

The library interacts via HTTP requests with a [nancy-http](https://github.com/rzippo/nancy-http) server.
The host and port of the server can be configured via the `nancy_http_server` class.

For an example of usage, see [here](api_test.py).
