# Nancy wrapper for Python

This project provides a Python library that provides (some of) the functionalities of the [Nancy library](https://github.com/rzippo/nancy) for Deterministic Network Calculus.

The library interacts via HTTP requests with a [nancy-http](https://github.com/rzippo/nancy-http) server.
The host and port of the server can be configured via the `nancy_http_server` class.

For an example of usage, see [here](api_test.py).

## Academic attribution

This software is an academic product, just like papers are. If you build on someone else's scientific ideas, you will obviously cite their paper reporting these ideas. 
This is standard academic practice. Like it or not, citations are the academic currency. 

```
If you use the Nancy library, or any software including parts of it or derived from it, 
we would appreciate it if you could cite the original paper describing it:

R. Zippo, G. Stea, "Nancy: an efficient parallel Network Calculus library", 
SoftwareX, Volume 19, July 2022, DOI: 10.1016/j.softx.2022.101178
```

The MIT license allows you to use this software for almost any purpose. However, if you use or include this software or its code (in full or in part) in your own, the fact that you are doing so in full compliance to the license does not exempt you from following standard academic practices regarding attribution and citation. 
This means that it is still your duty to ensure that users of your software:

  1. know that it use or includes our work, and 
  
  2. they can cite the above paper for correct attribution (along with your own work, possibly). 

The above two requirements are met, for open source projects, if you report the statement above in the readme of any code that uses or includes ours.
